## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for  the HTML elements body, header, section, ul, nav, nav a, h1, and footer. 
- The body rule sets the font, background color, text color, line spacing, smooth scrolling, and transition effects. 
- The header has a diagonal gradient background with white text, padding, centered content, and a bottom shadow and border. 
- The section element is centered, limited to 50% width, and has a top margin. 
- The ul element adds margin around lists. 
- The nav is displayed as a row of links, centered with spacing and padding. 
- The nav a rule makes links white, bold, without underlines, and adds a hover effect with an animated underline. 
- The h1 rule sets line spacing and underlines the heading text. 
- The footer is centered with padding, a gray background, darker text, a smaller font size, and a top margin.
- There are also the following classes: It also creates the following classes: .centered-div, .section-flex, .boxed-text, 
.card-style, .button, .card, .clip-image, .animate-text, .scroll-container, .scroll-item, .toggle-switch, 
.hero (inside media query), and .dark (applied to body). These classes are there to assist for animations and styling mostly,
I also wanted to experiment with them for practice so there's a few too many.
- I used the link, img, footer, header, ul, li, and button semantic elements
- I made a simple ball bouncing animation, and css animation of an image as well as two buttons
## Design Achievements
- **Used the Open Sans Font from Google Fonts**: I used Open Sans as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- I also created a color palatte with Adobe's Color Wheel
